            <h2>Description(Summary)</h2>
            <p>There's only one Jack Reacher. Accept no substitutes' Mick Herron'The thing about Lee Child's books is that you can't put the damn things down. . .there's something about his writing that's addictive. The Enemy is no exception. . .Superb.'
                Independent on Sunday North Carolina. New Year's Day, 1990. A soldier is found dead in a sleazy motel bed.Jack Reacher is the officer on duty. The soldier turns out to be a two-star general.The situation is bad enough, then Reacher finds
                the body of the general's wife.This stomach-churning thriller turns back the clock to a younger Reacher, in dogtags. A Reacher who still believes in the service. A Reacher who imposes army discipline. Even if only in his own pragmatic
                way.
